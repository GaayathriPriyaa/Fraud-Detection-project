# 🕵️ Fraud Detection Project

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project applies **Machine Learning for Fraud Detection**, focusing on identifying fraudulent transactions using classification models and anomaly detection techniques.  
The goal is to minimize financial risk and detect suspicious activity in real-time.  

---

## 🎯 Key Objectives  
- Analyze transaction datasets for fraud patterns.  
- Build and evaluate **classification models** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).  
- Apply **anomaly detection techniques** for unusual activity.  
- Compare model performance with metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and AUC-ROC.
